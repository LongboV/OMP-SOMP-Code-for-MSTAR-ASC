# OMP-SOMP-Code-for-MSTAR-ASC

The algorithm including `OMP` using alternative optimization, and the improved algorithm named `SOMP`.
We will release the code of the ordinary [OMP](https://github.com/LongboV/OMP-SOMP-Code-for-MSTAR-ASC) method firstly [1].
And we will release the code of the improved `SOMP` after the paper being published.
